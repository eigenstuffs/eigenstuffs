Current cool things:

- Solo developing a rhythm-based RPG with Godot Engine
- Leading a collaborative game dev project with ACM Studio at UCLA
- Honors thesis in climate politics with R for Departmental Honors

Ask me about:

- R, my interests are in predictive modeling and causal inference for social science
- Godot Engine, GDScript, or independent game development generally
